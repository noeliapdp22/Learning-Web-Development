# My FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains the projects I have completed on FreeCodeCamp. Each project is stored in its own folder with the corresponding HTML and CSS files.

## Projects

1. **Cat Photo App**  

**Description:**  
This is a simple webpage project called "Cat Photo App", where users can view photos of cats, read about things that cats love and hate, and submit a photo of their own cat using a form. This project is built using only HTML, without any advanced JavaScript or CSS.

2. **Cafe Menu**  

**Description:**  
This project is a simple "Cafe Menu" webpage that displays a menu with coffee and dessert options. Each item includes its name and price. The design is styled with CSS to create a visually appealing and easy-to-read menu, featuring images for each category and a background image that complements the cafe theme.

**Technologies used:**  
HTML, CSS

**Key Features:**
- Main header showcasing the name of the cafe, "Camper Cafe", with the year of establishment.
- Two sections: Coffee and Desserts, each with an image and list of items along with their prices.
- Clean layout with well-defined sections for coffee and dessert items, using `<article>` tags for each menu item.
- A footer with the cafe's address and a link to the FreeCodeCamp website.
- Responsive design using a background image and CSS for a comfortable user experience.

**What I learned:**  
This project allowed me to practice using CSS for layout and design, including the use of background images, text alignment, and creating a simple, aesthetically pleasing webpage. I also learned how to structure HTML content with semantic tags to improve accessibility and organization.

3. **Colored Markers**  

**Description:**  
This project is a simple webpage that visually represents colored markers using HTML and CSS. The markers are designed with gradient colors and shadows to mimic real-life markers. Each marker consists of two parts: a cap and a sleeve, styled with different colors and effects. The layout is clean, and the markers are displayed in a row.

**Technologies used:**  
HTML, CSS

**Key Features:**
- Three colored markers with red, green, and blue gradients.
- Use of `linear-gradient` for smooth color transitions in the markers' backgrounds.
- Application of `box-shadow` to create depth and a glowing effect around the markers.
- Clean layout with centered title and markers.
- The marker components are divided into two parts: the cap and the sleeve, each styled individually.

**What I learned:**  
This project helped me practice CSS styling techniques such as using gradients, shadows, and aligning elements. It also gave me an opportunity to practice creating simple, yet visually appealing designs with CSS, focusing on shapes and color theory.
